This publication is an extension of the final UK territorial greenhouse gas emission estimates
by source for 1990-2020 published in February 2022. It provides the latest estimates of 1990-
2020 greenhouse gas emissions in the UK by Standard Industrial Classification (SIC).

Manufacturing was the largest emitting SIC section at an estimated 69.2 million tonnes
of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) in 2020, followed by ‘electricity, gas, steam and
air conditioning supply’ with 56.4 MtCO2e, equating to 17.1% and 13.9% respectively of
all UK 2020 emissions.
Greenhouse gas emissions fell 9.5% from 2019 to 2020, almost three times the fall from
2018 to 2019, this would have been significantly impacted by the coronavirus (COVID-
19) pandemic and resulting restrictions brought in across the UK. Between 2019 and
2020, the SIC section with the largest proportional fall in total emissions was ‘activities
of households as employers; undifferentiated goods and services-producing activities of
households for own use’, which fell 31.3% (0.01 MtCO2e). Whereas electricity, gas,
steam and air conditioning supply had the largest absolute decrease in total emissions
from 2019 to 2020, decreasing by 8.9 MtCO2 e (13.7%).
29.1% of 2020 emissions (118.2 MtCO2e) are captured by ‘consumer expenditure’, a
non-SIC section which captures emissions associated with households and personal
travel, as opposed to business activity.

Introduction
This publication is an extension of the final UK territorial greenhouse gas emission estimates
by source for 1990-2020 published in February 2022. It provides the latest estimates of 1990-
2020 greenhouse gas emissions in the UK by Standard Industrial Classification (SIC), which
are presented in carbon dioxide equivalent units throughout this statistical release. Million
tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) is used within this report to provide consistency
and comparability with the report from the main part of this publication, whilst figures are
presented in thousand tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (ktCO2e) in the accompanying data
tables so that smaller figures can more easily be distinguished from zeros. Due to the COVID-
19 pandemic and the subsequent restrictions that were introduced in 2020 across the UK there
were major impacts on various aspects of society and the economy, which lead to a significant
impact on greenhouse gas emissions in the UK.
The Standard Industrial Classification is used to classify business and activities to the relevant
industries and includes a hierarchy of SIC codes to represent subsections of various industries.
Using this system allows this publication to report greenhouse gas emissions against their
relevant industry rather than their whole-economy sector, as is seen in the estimates by
National Communication sector that were published in February 2022. Emissions from a
particular industry can vary over time due to a number of factors, including expansions and
contractions in that industry as well as changes in practices. The total emissions presented
here are consistent with the data published in February by source sector.
In the data tables accompanying this report, tables 8.1 to 8.8 present emissions by SIC section
and group overall and for each gas, while table 8.9 shows how the emissions in each SIC
group break down into National Communication sectors. All of the figures in this report and in
tables 8.1-8.9 present estimates of the different greenhouse gases using the global warming
potentials from Working Group 1 of the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report.
1990-2020 greenhouse gas emissions by
SIC section
The overall reductions in territorial greenhouse gas emissions in the UK from 1990 to 2020
was 49.7% (400.7 MtCO2e), with the largest contributor being a 73.9% (159.7 MtCO2e) fall in
emissions from the ‘electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply’ section, due largely to a
switch from the use of coal in elec
