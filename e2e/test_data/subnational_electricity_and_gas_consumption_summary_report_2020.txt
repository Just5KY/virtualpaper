subnational Electricity and Gas Consumption Statistics
Regional and Local Authority, Great Britain, 2020
23 December 2021
 National Statistics
This publication provides national and subnational estimates of annual electricity and weather
corrected gas consumption in Great Britain. The latest estimates are for 2020 1.
Electricity
•
 There was a 4.8 per cent fall in total electricity consumption in Great Britain between 2019
and 2020, the largest year-on-year decrease recorded in these statistics (which go back to
2005). Eight out of the eleven countries/regions experienced record falls.
•
 The non-domestic sector consumes the most electricity, accounting for 58 per cent of total
electricity consumption in 2020. The 4.8 per cent fall in total electricity consumption was
driven by a record 11.1 per cent fall in total non-domestic electricity consumption and a 5.6
per cent increase in domestic consumption; the COVID-19 pandemic was probably a key
factor driving the changes in the electricity consumption between 2019 and 2020.
•
 For Great Britain as a whole, mean domestic electricity consumption per meter was 18.6
per cent lower in 2020 than in 2005. The reductions for individual countries/regions varied
from 15.6 per cent (in the South East) to 24.0 per cent (in Scotland).
Gas
•
 Total gas consumption in 2020 was 1.3 per cent higher than in 2018 (a pre-COVID-19
baseline year), with a 3.3 per cent increase in domestic consumption offset by a 2.0 per
cent decrease in non-domestic consumption. Unlike for electricity, the domestic sector is
the larger consumer, consuming 64 per cent of 2020 total gas consumption in Great Britain.
•
 Mean domestic gas consumption per meter was 28.0 per cent lower in 2020 than in 2005.
The downward trend in mean gas consumption per meter has levelled off in the past few
years, partly due to methodological changes, and likely in part due to the COVID-19
pandemic.
What you need to know about these statistics:
Estimates are based on meter point data provided by the electricity and gas industries from their administrative
systems. The gas consumption year for 2020 data is from mid-May 2020 to mid-May 2021, whereas the electricity
year more closely aligns to the calendar year. This means that the 2020 gas data includes the impact of various
COVID-19 restrictions in place in 2020 and 2021. This includes the second national lockdown which began in
November 2020 and the third national lockdown which began in January 2021. The 2019 gas data will also be
impacted by the first national lockdown in March 2020. The electricity data also includes the impact of COVID-19
restrictions, including all three national lockdowns (March 2020, November 2020 and January 2021).
Gas meters consuming above the industry standard threshold of 73,200 GWh per annum are categorised as
non-domestic, otherwise as domestic. This may result in some smaller commercial properties being classified as
domestic and can affect the trends over time. Improvements to methodology and data coverage over time mean
that the time series is revised. In general, data from 2017/18 onwards are more accurate and consistent.
Visit the Domestic Energy Map – an interactive map which displays average domestic electricity and gas
consumption as well as the proportion of domestic properties not on the gas grid. This map will be updated with
2020 consumption data in January 2022.

1. Introduction
1.1 Background
This document provides commentary on BEIS’ subnational estimates of electricity and weather
corrected gas consumption for Great Britain. Estimates are based on meter point data provided
by the electricity and gas industries from their administrative systems. In this document, both
the gas and electricity consumption years are referred to as 2020. It should be noted that the
2020 gas year runs from mid-May 2020 to mid-May 2021, whereas the electric year more
closely aligns to the calendar year; more detail on this is provided in the electricity and gas
chapters. All local authority tables from 2015 have been updated to align with the local
authority administrative boundaries as of 1 April 2021. A subnational methodology and
guidance booklet is published alongside this statistical release and provides further information
on the collection and compilation of these subnational estimates of consumption.
Estimates are published from domestic and non-domestic users and broken down by countries
and regions2 (within England), and local authorities. Data 3 are also published at the middle and
lower layer super output area for England and Wales, and intermediate geography zone and
data zone for Scotland.
For national estimates of domestic consumption, Table C9 of ECUK should be used.
Breakdowns of consumption by property attributes, household characteristics and business
characteristics are available through the National Energy Efficiency Data-Framework (NEED).
1.2 Users
The most significant use of the subnational consumption data is by Local Authorities and
devolved administrations, and other external users such as academics and industry. These
data have most commonly been used for targeting, to examine trends over time, or to assess
the effectiveness of carbon reduction and energy efficiency policies and initiatives.
Internally, these data are used by BEIS policy colleagues and other analysts to inform policy
development and help with the monitoring and evaluation of BEIS policies. The meter point gas
and electricity data collected for subnational consumption outputs are also used in NEED.
Feedback from users of these data is welcomed. If you have any queries or suggestions,
please contact us at energyefficiency.stats@beis.gov.uk. The team which produces this
publication may hold user engagement events in the future to understand how they can better
meet user needs: if you would like to be considered for an invitation to the next event, please

changes you may wish to see made to this publication.
